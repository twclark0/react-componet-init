# React Component Init

Boilerplate for creating and publishing react components to npm

## Description

Finally an easy way to create a React component and publish it to npm! This package is different than most as it is tested through React storybook. Now you can easily test your component in the storybook environment to ensure that everything is correct, then ship only the required code to npm/your projects.

### Commands

* `Git clone _project_` to clone project
* `npm run setup` to initialize package.json to your new component

#### Run storybook, tests, and linting on component

*   `npm start` to run a dev server to view changes during development (port:8080)
*   `npm test` to run unit tests.
*   `npm run lint` to lint files.
